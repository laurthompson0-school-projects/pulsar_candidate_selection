# Pulsar Candidate Selection

This project utlizes the [HTRU2 dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2) for pulsar candidate classification.
The purpose of the dataset is to show that the set of 8 features are effective for classifying potential pulsar candidates.
For this project we confirmed the classification results of the paper
'Fifty Years of Pulsar Candidate Selection: From simple filters to a new principled real-time classification approach', R. J. Lyon et al.
as well as determined if we could get better classification results using several different classification methods.
Additionally, we did an analysis of feature importance as well as performing principal component analysis of the features
to determine if we could effectively further reduce the set of features.
